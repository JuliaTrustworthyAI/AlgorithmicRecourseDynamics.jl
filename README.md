# Algorithmic Recourse

This repository contains all the work produced in relation to my first research topic: the effect of endogenous domain and model shifts on algorithmic recourse.

## AlgorithmicRecourse.jl

There is a companion Julia package to this repository. It is not yet registered, but can be installed from Github like so:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/pat-alt/AlgorithmicRecourse.jl")
```
