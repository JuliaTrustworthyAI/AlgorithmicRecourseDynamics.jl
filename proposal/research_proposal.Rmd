# Introduction

In their NeurIPS 2021 paper @upadhyay2021towards demonstrate that existing approaches to algorithmic recourse are not robust to exogenous domain and model shifts. A related and so far unexplored idea is that recourse itself may lead to endogenous domain and model shifts, if a substantial share of individuals acts on it. We believe that this can have implications on the validity and cost of algorithmic recourse that have so far been overlooked.
