Our results in Section \@ref(empirical-2) indicate that state-of-the-art approaches to Algorithmic Recourse induce substantial domain and model shift, if implemented at scale in practice. These induced shifts can and should be considered as an (expected) external cost of individual recourse. While they do not affect the individual directly as long as we look at the individual in isolation, they can been seen to affect the broader group of stakeholders in automated data-driven decision-making. We have seen, for example, that out-of-sample model performance generally deteriorates in our simulation experiments. In practice, this can be seen as a cost to model owners, that is the group of stakeholders using the model as decision-making tool. As we have set out in the introduction, these model owners will generally be unwilling to carry that cost, and hence can be expected to stop offering recourse to individuals altogether. This in turn is costly to those individuals that would otherwise derive utility from being offered recourse. 

So, where does this leave us? We would argue that the expected external costs of individual recourse should be shared by all stakeholders. The most straight-forward way to achieve this is to introduce a penalty for external costs in the counterfactual search objective function, as we have set out in Equation \@ref(eq:collective). This will on average lead to more costly counterfactual outcomes. But it may help to avoid extreme scenarios, in which minimal-cost recourse is reserved to a tiny minority of individuals. We have shown various types of shift-mitigating strategies that can be used to this end. Since all of these strategies can be seen simply as specific adaption of Equation \@ref(eq:collective), they can be applied to any of the various counterfactual generators studied here.
