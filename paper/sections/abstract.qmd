# Abstract

Existing work on Counterfactual Explanations (CE) and Algorithmic Recourse (AR) has largely been limited to the static setting: given some classifier we are interested in finding close, actionable, realistic, sparse, diverse and ideally causally founded counterfactuals. The ability of CE to handle dynamics like data and model drift remains a largely unexplored research challenge at this point. Only one recent work considers the implications of exogenous domain and model shifts. This project instead focuses on endogenous dynamics, that is shifts that occur when AR is actually implemented by a proportion of individuals. Early findings suggest that the involved shifts may be large with important implications on the validity of AR and the overall characteristics of the sample population.
